#PRJ-Spring_Mabebe

Mabebe is a personal project which I started in order to pursue these goals :

1) I want to keep my baby's history in my personal web. But ordinary blog doesn't suit into the form of simple diary, and I wanted to avoid using Facebook or Instagram to protect my baby's privacy.(He might punch me after he grow up)
2) Build Website based on Spring backend.
3) Apply React to front-end.
4) Android App dev'



#Language / Tools

Back-end : Spring-boot framework (JAVA) Front-end : jQuery + bootstrap Gradle
